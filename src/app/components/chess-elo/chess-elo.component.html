      <p>London was bustling this week as thousands of excited fans flocked to
        the annual Bobby Fischer chess tournament. After much anticipation going into
        the week, one player in particular was stealing the headlines.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Gary Hua</strong>, a native to Vancouver, had been unstoppable going into the week. With a pre-tournament
      elo rating of 1794, which surpassed all others in the field, he would be a tough opponent to beat.
      </p>
      <p>Those immediately following behind him on the leaderboard also showed promise, including the young
        19 year-old phenom, <strong>Patrick Schilling</strong>. Raised from a modest upbringing, he's been touted as one of the
        most exciting new players to enter the field.
      </p>
      <p>Although both of these players had promising outlooks, #2 ranked <strong>Loren Schwiebert</strong> had an advantage when it
        came to strength of schedule. From the chart below you can see that Loren's opponents going into
        the tournament had a much lower average pre-tournament elo rating than the opponents of Gary Hua or
        Patrick Schilling.

            From the chart above, you can see that some players outperformed expectations, boosting their
            elo ratings quite a bit. <strong>Jacob Lavalley</strong> had a huge week. Coming into the tournament
            as the player with the lowest elo rating, he fought hard against some big contenders, including one of the world's
            top players, <strong>Gary Dee Swathell</strong>, in game 2. Other players that had a big week are below,
            including hometown London favorite, <strong>Zachary Houghton</strong>.

          On the flipside, you can see that some players had a dreadful week. The pieces just weren't falling into
          place for <strong>Chiedozie Okorie</strong>, who lost 94 points off of her elo rating. Also, one of the
          world's top players, <strong>Loren Schwiebert</strong>, would like to forget this year's performance, after
          dropping 64 points off of her pre-tournament elo rating -- 5th worst of the players in the tournament. She was
          hoping to take advantage of the strength of schedule, but the rooks just weren't in her favor.
